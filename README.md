# File Logger Tree for Fimber  
  
[![Pub](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_fimber_filelogger.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_fimber_filelogger)
  
A tree for the [Fimber Flutter library](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_fimber) that will write the logs to a File for each day.  

## Getting started
### 1) Dependency setup
  
First import the library to your project in your `pubspec.yaml`:  

- 1.2.x uses `intl` 0.17+
- 1.1.x uses `intl` 0.16+
- 1.0.x uses `intl` 0.15.x

```yaml
flutter_fimber_filelogger: ^1.1.1+1

# or 

flutter_fimber_filelogger: ^1.0.2
```

### 2) Import the library in your Dart code

```dart
import 'package:flutter_fimber_filelogger/flutter_fimber_filelogger.dart';
```  

### 3) Plant the tree  
  
```dart
Fimber.plantTree(FileLoggerTree());  
```  
  
## Files

The files will be stored in the `[getApplicationDocumentsDirectory]/logs` directory.

For each day, a new File will be created.
An auto-clean mechanism is available, where you have to specify the number of days to keep the files onto the disk:

```dart
Fimber.plantTree(FileLoggerTree(numberOfDays: 5));  
```

To disable it, just pass a `null` value.
